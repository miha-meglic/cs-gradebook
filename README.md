### A simple gradebook desktop application written in Java.

It was a school assignment that developed in a bit of an actual application.  
It is very basic and needs a lot more work. Maybe I'll come back to it and finish it but for now I'll just leave it here as a monument to simpler times :wink:

It comes with a Gradle wrapper, but is not translated to English and the database is not fully implemented.  
For now I'm archiving this project.
